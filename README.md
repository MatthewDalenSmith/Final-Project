## Problem Breakdown & Computational Thinking (You can add a flowchart and write the four pillars of computational thinking  briefly in bullets) 
decomposition - two steps to the code. Inputting a target value, and advancing the binary search algorithm
pattern recognition - this uses a similar binary search engine to other problems, however it includes a large range of numbers that span the whole way across rather than smaller lists with missing numbers.
abstraction - the most important info is just the execution of the binary search. everything else is extra details but the required functions are the inputting of a target and then making the search work.
algorithm design - inputs are the target value and the less, yes, more buttons. outputs show the steps of binary search. constraints are only being able to choose values 1-100.

## Steps to Run 
to run just open the hugging face link it'll take you to the page.
for playing the game use the slider to pick a number and hit place order to lock that in as your target value, the chef will then reply with the mid value of the binary search.
use the less, yes, and more buttons to advance the steps of binary search. if you hit the wrong button the game will say incorrect.
once you've hit the target value you can place a new order or hit the reset button to reload the page.
