## Problem Breakdown & Computational Thinking (You can add a flowchart and write the four pillars of computational thinking  briefly in bullets) 

## Steps to Run 
to run just open the hugging face link it'll take you to the page.
for playing the game use the slider to pick a number and hit place order to lock that in as your target value, the chef will then reply with the mid value of the binary search.
use the less, yes, and more buttons to advance the steps of binary search. if you hit the wrong button the game will say incorrect.
once you've hit the target value you can place a new order or hit the reset button to reload the page
